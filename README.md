## About

**Pixel Worlds API** is a *python* wrapper for Pixel Worlds' **data**. It was built to get **blocks** info, **recipes**, **wearables** and also **events**.

You can easily get information without storing thousands of pixel worlds data time to time. With just a single module, you can get everything you want.
